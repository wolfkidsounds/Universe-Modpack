# Universe-Modpack
A Modpack about Space Exploration, Hardcore Minecraft, Avatar and about a server/streaming community.

Originated by the idea to play through "vanilla" minecraft and slay the ender dragon. The pack quickly became inspired by other mods and ideas.
The pack later evolved into a heavily modded version of minecraft including some thoughts about server mechanics and additional "hardcore-ness".

**THIS PACK IS NOT BEING DEVELOPED ANY FURTHER DUE TO INACTIVITY OF THE COMMUNITY**
